### Putnam Practice

# About
This document is a work-in-progress (May 2023-) compilation of solutions to the Putnam problems from 1938-2023 written with the inexperienced problem solver in mind. While the official solutions and those provided by Kiran S. Kedlaya (see https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/) are excellent, they do not guide the reader through all the twists and turns needed to be maneuvered before reaching an elegant solution. My goal is to help train the reader and myself to develop an intuition and plan of attack to tackle these difficult problems like an experienced problem solver. The solutions are guided and each insight is elucidated.
